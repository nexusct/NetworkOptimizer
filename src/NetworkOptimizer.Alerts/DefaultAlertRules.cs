        //     predecessor, and AlertProcessingService resolves the old row BEFORE rules are
        //     consulted. Cooldown keys are per (site, rule, device), so a replacement shares the
        //     key of the alert it just closed: an obstruction escalating Warning -> Critical
        //     inside the cooldown would resolve the Warning and then have the Critical suppressed,
        //     leaving a critically obstructed dish with no open alert at all. The WAN outage family
        //     is immune only because a total supersedes a PARTIAL - a different rule, a different
        //     key.
        //  2. It is redundant anyway. StarlinkAlertEvaluator publishes on state changes only, and
        //     is where the real throttling lives: sustain windows and hysteresis on the gated
        //     conditions, "new evidence only" on the dish's own codes, and edge-triggering on
